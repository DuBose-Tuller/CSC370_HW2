-use a heuristic for tree isomorphism with <depth, terminals, nonterminals>
    -at each generation, regenerate trees that have a 'shape' already represented in the population
-perform crossover only above a certain 'edit distance' threshold
    -count number of overlapped nodes that are different
-Some kind of entropy measure on the evaluations

Improving Crossover
-don't do it on parents with the same fitness (Gustafson 2005)
-pick a random spot in parent 1, but try all of the possible spots in parent 2, and keep the one with the best fitness (Majeed and Ryan 2007)
    -or really any kind of "try a bunch, keep the best" method

Reducing Bloat (section 4)
-Automatically assign a low fitness to individuals with a lot of nodes (Poli 2003)
